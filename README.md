This is a working repository for arduino projects

#vac-chamber-controller
Vacuum Chamber Controller Mk1.

Incorporates LCD display, BMP280 sensor, rotary encoder and switch, vacuum pump relay and solenoid control circuits.

BMP280 reads pressure and temperature.
LCD screen displays pressure and temp. Shows remaining time during vacuum cycle
Rotary encoder allows selection of vacuum pressure and timer lenghth.
Switch starts pump cycle
Timer begins when target pressure is achieved
Pressure released when timer elapsed or cycle ended with switch

#hydro-clime
Hydroponic Climate Monitor and Controller

BMP280 Atmospheric pressure and temperature
DHT11/22 Ambient temperature and humdity

Controls climate making use of aircon/dehumidifier, extractor fans, and heaters.
